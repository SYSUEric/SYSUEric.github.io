            <p>
              Luminescence is often weakened or quenched at high concentrations, a phenomenon widely known as ‘concentration quenching’
              (Figure 1, A). A main cause for the quenching process is mechanistically associated with the ‘formation of
              aggregates’, which is probably why the concentration quenching effect has frequently been referred to as ‘aggregation-caused
              quenching’ (ACQ). </p>
            <p>
              In 2001, we discovered an uncommon luminogen system, in which aggregation worked constructively, rather than destructively
              as in the conventional systems.20,21 We found that a series of silole derivatives were non-emissive in dilute
              solutions but became highly luminescent when their molecules were aggregated in concentrated solutions or cast
              into solid films (Figure 1, B). Since the light emission was induced by aggregate formation, we termed the
              process ‘aggregation-induced emission’ (AIE).</p>

              Mechanism
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              In a dilute solution, six phenyl rotors in an HPS molecule undergo dynamic intramolecular rotations against its silacyclopentadiene
              or silole stator, which non-radiatively annihilates its excited state and renders its molecule non-luminescent.
              In the aggregates, the HPS molecules cannot pack through a pi-pi stacking process due to its propeller shape,
              while the intramolecular rotations of its aryl rotors are greatly restricted owing to the physical constraint.
              This restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR) blocks the non-radiative pathway and opens up the radiative
              channel. As a result, the HPS molecules become emissive in the aggregate state.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to our proposed mechanism, the RIR process is responsible for the AIE effect. We have conducted a number of control
              experiments (decreasing temperature, increasing viscosity, applying pressure, etc.) to externally activate
              the RIR process. We have also used covalent bonds to fasten the aryl rotors to internally set off the RIR process
              at the molecular level. In response to both the external and internal controls, the luminogens become emissive,
              thus offering experimental evidence to support our mechanistic hypothesis.

              New concepts lead to new applications. In principle, the AIE effect can be utilized to do useful work wherever the RIR process
              is involved. The possibilities are therefore plentiful, limited probably only by our imagination. Here are

            <p>
              Our groups have developed an alternative scheme based on AIE luminogens for selective detection and quantitative assay of
              CO2 gas. In this scheme, HPS is dissolved in an amine solvent such as dipropylamine (DPA), giving a non-luminescent
              solution. When CO2 gas is bubbled through the solution, it reacts with DPA to yield a carbamate ionic liquid
              (CIL; Figure 5B). The high viscosity and polarity of CIL slow down the torsional motions of the aryl rotors
              and induce the HPS molecules to aggregate. As the RIR process is set off, the HPS emission is turned on. With
              more CO2 gas bubbled through the solution, more CIL is formed. The PL intensity thus mirrors the CO2 level
              (Figure 5C), which provides an inexpensive and visually discernable method for quantitative detection CO2 gas
              with applications as diverse as predicting volcanic eruptions and signalling danger in the environment.

            <p>
              An example of explosive detection system using an AEE active hyperbranched polymer as the probe is shown in Figure 6. The
              fluorescence of the nanoaggregates of the polymer suspended in an aqueous mixture is progressively attenuated
              with the sequential addition of PA. The emission quenching can be clearly distinguished at a PA level ([PA])
              as low as 1 ppm. The I-[PA] plot gives a swiftly upward-bending curve rather than a linear line, suggestive
              of a superamplification effect (Figure 6C). The quenching constant is 1.35 X 105 L mol-1, much higher than
              those of other explosive sensors. The 3D topological structures of the hyperbranched polymer and its aggregates
              provide many internal cavities for the explosive molecules and various diffusion paths for the excited states,
              leading to the extra-ordinary sensing performance. The superamplification effect has been observed in many
              AIE and AEE nanoaggregate systems, proving that it is a common feature for the AIE- and AEE-based sensing systems.

            <p>A conceptually new “light-up” biosensor with a high specificity for D-glucose (Glu) in aqueous media has been

              fluorogen was oligomerized with Glu because of restriction of the intramolecular rotations of the aryl rotors
              of TPE by formation of the oligomer. Little change in the light emission was observed when 1 was mixed with
              D-fructose, D-galactose, or D-mannose, as these saccharides are unable to oligomerize with the fluorogen.</p>

            <p>
              A probe for thiol detection was developed by modifying TPE with a maleimide (MI) group. While TPE–MI adduct 70a is nonemissive
              in both solution and solid states due to the photoinduced electron transfer from TPE to MI unit, its thiolated
              derivative 70b shows AIE effect (Figure 8A). In other words, 70a is a ‘caged’ AIE luminogen. Its aggregates
              deposited on TLC plates can be used to differentiate cysteine from other amino acids through the thiol - ene
              click reaction (Figure 8B). Because the click reaction is very fast and efficient at room temperature, 70a
              can also be used for labelling proteins carrying cysteine residues in the physiological media and in the poly(acrylamide)
              gel electrophoresis (PAGE) assays.</p>

            <p>Because of their good water miscibility, ionic luminophores have often been used for cell imaging applications.
              However, at high concentrations, their charges can perturb membrane potential and cellular physiology. On the
              other hand, at low concentrations, the small numbers of the luminophores that have entered into the cellular
              interiors can be easily photobleached in the imaging process. During the cell division process and when the
              confluent cells are passaged, the intracellular dyes often diffuse back to the extracellular media owing to
              the existence of the concentration gradient. This leads to a decrease in the emission of the stained cells
              and a concurrent increase in the solution (or background) emission as well as a random staining in a cell co-culture
              system.</p>

            <p>Aminated silole derivatives 74 are non-ionic luminogens that spontaneously aggregate into nanoparticles in aqueous
              media (Figure 9A). The nanoparticles are cytocompatible and can be internalized via an endocytosis process.
              Due to their AIE nature and electrical neutrality, the luminogens can be used in high concentrations in cell
              imaging processes. The nanoaggregates indelibly stain the HeLa cells because the internalized particles are
              difficult to escape from the cellular compartments. The strong retention of the nanoparticles in the HeLa cells
              prevents the cross-staining between different cell lines and enables the fluorescence cell differentiation
              (Figure 9B). The internalized particles are withheld inside the HeLa cells so robustly that they remain visible
              for a long period (up to four passages), permitting visual monitoring of the growth of a specific type of cell
              line (Figure 9C). </p>

            <p>For a protein to perform its biological functions, it must assume a specific chain conformation. The development
              of luminescent tools for studying protein conformations is thus of obvious importance. Investigation of global
              stability of protein chains in the presence of denaturants has attracted much interest, as it offers mechanistic
              insights into protein (un)folding processes. Though intermediate states are often involved in the (un)folding
              processes of many proteins, they are difficult to detect due to the lack of appropriate probes. </p>

            <p>We developed an emission turn-on sensor for human serum albumin (HSA) using a sulfonated TPE (73) as probe. The
              emission of 73 in an aqueous buffer was switched on in the presence of HSA. The HSA-triggered emission allowed
              73 to be used as a visualization agent in the PAGE assays. HSA is a main protein component of the blood plasma.
              Its hydrophobic regions are capable of binding with insoluble endo- and exogenous compounds like fatty acids
              and drugs. The hydrophobicity of the phenyl rings of 73 prompted the luminogenic molecules to enter into and
              aggregate inside the hydrophobic cavities or pockets of the folding structures of HSA chains (Fig. 34). Utilizing
              the AIE nature of 73 and the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA
              at 350 nm to the AIE emission of 73 at 470 nm, the unfolding trajectory of HSA chains induced by denaturant
              of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was traced, which revealed a three-step transition with a stable moltenglobule
              intermediate involved in the unfolding process. </p>

            <p>The flat molecule of anthracene (59) is ACQ active. It is transformed to an AIE luminogen by decorating it with
              a TPE unit. The solution of adduct 60 is non-emissive but its aggregates luminesce very efficiently (ΦF,a =
              100%). This strategy works equally well for other ACQ molecules. Embellishing an ACQ-active TPA core with multiple
              AIE-active TPE peripherals, for example, affords adduct 62 with combined advantages of the two components:
              holetransport capability (TPA) and AIE activity (TPE). Thanks to the electronic conjugation of the TPE component,
              the excellent hole-transporting property of the TPA component is well retained in 62, experimentally verifying
              the rationale and feasibility of our new strategy.</p>
            <p>The conventional approaches mitigate the ACQ effect but bring about new problems. In contrast, our new approach
              solves the ACQ problem without causing undesired sideeffects. The examples discussed above show that embossing
              ACQ luminophores with TPE units is a general and versatile strategy for eliminating ACQ effect and generating
              new AIE luminogens. Our new strategy takes advantage of the natural process of aggregate formation and therefore
              does not suffer from temporal and spatial instabilities. </p>

            <p>To attain full-colour display, AIE luminogens with emission colours covering the whole range of visible lights
              have been designed and prepared. Some examples of the luminogens are shown in. Many OLEDs using the AIE luminogens
              as the emitting layers have been fabricated. </p>
