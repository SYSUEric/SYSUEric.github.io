            <p>
              As can be seen from Scheme 1, the backbones of the acetylenic polymers are pi-conjugated due to the electronic communications
              between their electronically unsaturated repeat units. This unique electronic structure has the potential to
              endow the polymers with novel properties which are very difficult, if not impossible, to access by their congeners
              of condensation and vinyl polymers with electronic saturation. The prerequisite to realize this attractive
              potential is to establish versatile processes for synthesizing the polymers (Scheme 2).

              Of particular interest and technological implication is the enhancement in the electrical conductivity by photoirradiation,
              commonly known as photoconductivity (PC).
            </p>
            <p>Through systematic studies, Tang’s group has observed the following structureproperty relationships in the photoconductions
              in the substituted PAs: (i) The substituted PAs containing electrondonating substituents exhibit higher PCs
              than those with electron-accepting ones. (ii) The PCs are further improved when the electron donors are simultaneously
              hole-transporters. (iii) The photoconduction becomes even more efficient when the donor substituents are mesogenic
              and can be packed in an ordered fashion.</p>

            <p>
              The study of luminescence properties of π-conjugated polymers is a hot topic of great current interest. Whereas PA is an
              archetypal π-conjugated polymer, little work had been done on the development of light-emitting PAs (LEPAs)
              in the early days, because PA itself is a very poor luminophore. We extended our efforts to explore the possibility
              of developing efficient LEPA systems. Modifications of molecular structure of PA, such as attachments of the
              pendant groups with different electronic and steric effects, have been used to tune the conjugation length
              along the polyene backbone and the electronic interaction between the polymer chains. These approaches have
              worked well and led to the generation of a large variety of LEPAs with high photoluminescence (PL) yields and
              good electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies.

            <p>
              Aggregation of conjugated polymer chains in the solid state often results in the formation of less-emissive or nonemissive
              species such as excimers and exciplexes, which partially or completely quench the luminescence of the polymers.
              This aggregation-caused quenching effect has been a thorny problem in the development of efficient polymer
              light emitting diodes (PLEDs) because the conjugated polymers are commonly used as thin solid films in the
              EL devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we have found a group of chromophores which exhibit an invaluable effect of aggregation-induced emission (AIE):
              they are virtually nonluminescent when molecularly dissolved in good solvents but become strongly emissive
              when aggregated in poor solvents or fabricated into solid films. We further incorporated these chromophores
              into polymers to produce a group of unique polymers showing AIE or AIEE behavior.

              IV. Fluorescence Sensing
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Luminescent acetylenic polymers have been actively utilized for fluorescence-sensing applications by virtue of their rapid,
              specific, and sensitive PL responses to a variety of analytes. The attractive attribute that has sparked great
              interest in the exploration of fluorescent polymers as potential sensors is their extraordinary signal amplification
              effect.

            </div>
            <p>An example of explosive detection system using an AEE active hyperbranched polymer as the probe is shown. The
              fluorescence of the nanoaggregates of the polymer suspended in an aqueous mixture is progressively attenuated
              with the sequential addition of PA. The I–[PA] plot gives a swiftly upward-bending curve rather than a linear
              line, suggestive of a super-amplification effect. The 3D topological structures of the hyperbranched polymer
              and its aggregates provide many internal cavities for the explosive molecules and various diffusion paths for
              the excited states, leading to the extra-ordinary sensing performance. The super-amplification effect has been
              observed in many AIE and AEE nanoaggregate systems, proving that it is a common feature for the AIE- and AEE-based
              sensing systems.

            <p>We have developed a sequential chemosensor based on imidazole-containing LEPA Among many different kinds of metal
              ions, only Cu2+ ion can completely and efficiently quench or turn off the strong fluorescence with a detection
              limit as low as 1.48 ppm. The Cu2+-quenched light emission can be turned on by the addition of CN- ion, thus
              allowing the polymer to work as a unique dual-response sequential chemosensor for the detection of copper and
              cyanide ions. </p>

              Conjugated organic materials exhibiting strong NLO properties and fast response time have attracted considerable interest
              because of their potential high-tech applications in various optical and photonic devices. Of particular interest
              is optical limiter, which is a novel optical material that transmits light of normal intensity but attenuates

              Biological systems are in essence molecular machines built upon chiral biopolymers, which smartly respond to temperature
              change, pH variation, foreign entrant, light stimulus, mechanical force, electric and magnetic fields, etc.
              It is of great interest to develop stimuli-responsive smart biomimetic materials based on chiral synthetic
              polymers, especially those capable of chiral discrimination or enantiomeric recognition.

              Macroscopically processable polymers with high RI values are promising candidate materials for an array of practical applications
              in optoelectronic devices, including optical waveguides, memories, and holographic image recording systems.
              From the structural point of view, the functionalized acetylenic polymers have the potential to diplay high
              RI values, because their monomer repeat units contain many components that fulfill the theoretical requirements:
              electronically mobile aromatic rings, slim triple-bonded rods, highly polarizable heteroatoms or groups, heavy
              atoms, metallic elements, etc. Indeed, many linear and hyperbranched acetylenic polymers developed by Tang’s
              group show RI values (∼1.61-2.07) much higher than those of the conventional polymers.

              Photosensitive polymers have been widely used as photoresist materials in many high tech processes, such as photolithography
              and photoengraving. If a processable polymer is both photosensitive and light-emitting, it will be an excellent
              candidate material for the fabrication of luminescent patterns by photolithography processes. The generation
              of fluorescent patterns is important for the constructions photonic and electronic devices and biological sensing
              and probing systems, e.g., LCD, OLED, and medicinal diagnostic biochip.
